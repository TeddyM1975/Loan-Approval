### Project Overview
This project aims to build a model that predicts loan approval outcomes based on various customer features, such as income, assets, credit score, etc. We use techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning modeling to achieve high predictive accuracy.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:

 - Loan ID
 - Self Employment
 - Cibil Score
 - Residential Assets Value
 - Commercial Assets Value
 - Luxury Assets Value
 - Bank Asset Value
 - Income Annum
 - Number of Dependents
 - Loan Amount
 - Loan Term
 - Education (Graduate / Not Graduate)
 - Target (Loan Status): Approval or Rejection

### Project Workflow
 - **Data Exploration**: Analyze the data, visualize distributions, and understand feature relationships.
 - **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.
 - **Feature Engineering**: Extract and select relevant features.
 - **Model Building**: Train various machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
 - **Evaluation**: Assess the model on test data and interpret results.

### Model Performance
The model achieved:

- Accuracy: 91%.
- Precision: 91%: Rejected, 90% Approved.
- Recall: 83%: Rejected, 95% Approved.
- F1 Score: 87%: Rejected, 93%: Approved.
